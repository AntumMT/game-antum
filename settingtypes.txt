# There are 3 styles available. You can choose between the default
# progress-bar-like bars and the good old statbars like you know from
# vanilla Minetest.
#
# The following values are allowed:
# | ■ progress_bar:
# |     ● A horizontal progress-bar-like bar with a label, showing
# |       numerical value (current, maximum), and an icon. These
# |       bars usually convey the most information. This is the
# |       default and recommended value.
# | ■ statbar_classic:
# |     ● Classic statbar, like in vanilla Minetest. Made out of
# |       up to 20 half-symbols. Those bars represent the vague
# |       ratio between the current value and the maximum value.
# |       1 half-symbol stands for approximately 5% of the maximum
# |       value.
# | ■ statbar_modern:
# |     ● Like the classic statbar, but also supports background
# |       images, this kind of statbar may be considered to be
# |       more user-friendly than the classic statbar. This bar
# |       type closely resembles the mod “Better HUD” [hud] by

# |       from the first, the next is above the first, the
# |       next is right of the third, etc.
# | ■ stack_up:
# |     ● The HUD bars are stacked vertically, going upwards.
# | ■ stack_down:
# |     ● The HUD bars are stacked vertically, going downwards.
hudbars_alignment_pattern (HUD bars alignment pattern) enum zigzag zigzag,stack_up,stack_down

# This setting allows you to specify the order of the HUD bars explicitly. If left empty
# (the default), the health and breath indicators come first, additional indicators
# may appear in any order. This setting is quite technical and normal users probably do not
# need to worry about it.
#
# Syntax:
# The setting has to be specified as a comma-seperated list of key=value pairs, where a key
# refers to the identifier of a HUD bar and the value refers to the slot number of where the
# HUD bar should be placed. The slot number must be an integer greater of equal to 0. Where
# the HUD bars will be displayed exactly depends on the alignment pattern being used.
# All HUD bars to which no order value has been applied will fill in all slots which have
# not been occupied by the HUD bars specified in this setting, the slots will be filled in
# from the lowest slot number.
# Note that the order of those remaining HUD bars is not fixed, it basically just boils
# down on which mod “came” first. Don't worry, the mod will still work perfectly fine, this
# setting is entirely optional.
# The identifier for the health bar is “health” and the identifier for the breath bar is
# “breath”. For other HUD bars, you have to learn it from the mod which is supplying them.
#
# Be careful not to use slot indices twice, or else different HUD bars will be drawn over
# each other!
#
# Example: “breath=0, health=1”
# This makes the breath bar first and the health bar second, which is the opposite order
# of the default one.
