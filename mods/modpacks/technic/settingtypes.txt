#    Safety feature for the chainsaw tool aimed to prevent cutting structures
#    built by players.
#
#    Trunk nodes generated by mapgen have a rotation of '0' whereas manually
#    placed trunks usually have another value. However, some mods might generate
#    trees with rotation != 0, which renders the chainsaw useless on them.
#
#    Disabling this feature will sacrifice safety for convenience.
