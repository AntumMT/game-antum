# Simple Fast Inventory Buttons [`sfinv_buttons`]
This mod adds a new tab (“More”) to the Simple Fast Inventory [`sfinv`] on
which other mods can add their buttons to make it easier to access their
core functionality.

The idea is to free users from typing in boring chat commands. ;-)

Minetest version 5.0.0 or later is required.

Version: 1.1.2
(This mod uses [semantic versioning](http://semver.org/) as of version 2.0.0 of the standard.)
