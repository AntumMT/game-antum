## Information

This works only with latest git of Minetest (ass of 16.10.13).
With older versions, you'll only see a one node large rotor.

Crafting:

```
MATERIAL     -nothing-  MATERIAL   
             stick               
MATERIAL     -nothing-  MATERIAL   
```

With MATERIAL beeing

* steel ingot for 4-blade windmill
* homedecor plastic sheet for 3-blade turbine
* white wool for historic windmill sails
* wood for historic windmill without sails (rotates very slowly)
* stick for us-style farm windmill

Clockwise- and counterclockwise rotating rotors can be crafted into each other.


The axis is mostly a decorative node to which you can attach your mill rotors.

Axis:

```
steel_ingot    stick    steel_ingot
```
