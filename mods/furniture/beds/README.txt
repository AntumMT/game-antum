Beds Redux Mod v1.0
By Leslie E. Krause

Beds Redux is a complete rewrite of the Beds mod from Minetest Game. That's right, beds 
got a complete makeover from the ground up!

While striving to improve the beds mod for the JT2 server, I realized that the original 
source code was becoming too unmanageable. So in January, I decided to start from scratch 
developing Beds Redux with a fully revamped API and many new and exciting features both 
for developers and players alike.

Note: Since Beds Redux overrides the builtin respawn function of Minetest, it is strongly
recommended to disable the Spawn mod from Minetest Game in order to avoid conflicts.
