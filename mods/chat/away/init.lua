-- Away mod by kahrl               --
-- Idea by jordan4ibanez & kahrl   --
-- Version 1.0                     --
-------------------------------------


--
-- Set yourself as away using the server command
--   /away
-- You can also give a reason, as follows:
--   /away Saving the princess
--
-- Each time somebody mentions your nick, the server will print a message
-- that you are currently away (however, not more than once per minute).
--
-- You can set yourself as no longer away with another /away,
-- or by talking. If somebody tried to talk to you while you were away,
-- the server will inform everyone that you're back. Doing something else
-- in-game (e.g. moving around, digging, building, etc.) does not reset
-- the away status.
--
-- You can check your current away status:
--   /away?
-- You can also check any other player's status:
--   /away? name
--
-- Note: an away reason is hidden in case the user in question is
-- missing the 'shout' privilege.
--


-- The mod version
AWAY_VERSION = '1.0'

-- The name of the /away command
AWAY_COMMAND = '/away'

-- The name of the /away? command
AWAYP_COMMAND = '/away?'

-- The minimum time between away notifications, in seconds. Defaults to 60.
AWAY_INFORM_INTERVAL = 60

-- The interval at which the mod looks for disconnected players, and resets
-- their AFK status.
-- This could be removed if a register_on_disconnectplayer callback was added.
AWAY_CHECK_DISCONNECT_INTERVAL = 60


-- Set of away players
local away_players = {}

-- Maps player name to reason or nil if not applicable
local away_reasons = {}

-- Maps player to the time others were last informed about their afk-ness,
-- or nil if not applicable
local away_last_inform = {}

-- List of inform messages to send on globalstep
-- The purpose of this is that inform messages show up *after* the
-- chat message that caused them
local away_inform_outbox = {}
